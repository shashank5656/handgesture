This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize hand gestures in real-time, and provides voice feedback using the pyttsx3 library. The system captures hand gestures through the webcam, processes them, and provides real-time recognition with both visual output and voice-based feedback for gestures like "thumbs up," "peace sign," and more.
